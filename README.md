# hello-world

Let's do it! 

My name is Przemek. I am from Polish. My english is not good but I think you understand everything from me. Okey - I know - I should not write this part about my english - but I want be a honest. I like video games. I like play video games, "create" video games, and think about video games. Analyse topic about video games. Most of my time I spend in unity3d. I create simple projects or more complex. Sometimes I create only one mechanism. When I coding or create my idea - I feel so good. The best moment is when this was I created - is the same or nearing to picture of my imagination. I think the programming and design I express myself. At least I'm trying do this. Ofcourse I interesting not only Unity3d and video games. Sometimes I have idea for an application for linux, windows or android. I'm trying I learn other programming language - it depends what I want. So GitHub is the best place where you can publish, display or keep your ideas or struggles.

This is simple tutorial project, because I just learn a github.
